# Hello, I'm Josh (he/him) 👋 

I'm a former journalist who has swapped writing stories for writing code. After always taking an interest in problems, to reporting on them, I now want to play a fundamental role in solving them by creating digital products through software development.
+ I'm currently looking for a junior software developer role, graduate scheme, or apprenticeship. 

## Some of my favourite projects (pinned below) 🚀
+ Album Club - A responsive React-based web app that my friends and I use for our weekly album listening club. We use the app to suggest albums and write reviews, in a bid to vary our own music digest. Made use of Firebase Firestore to store data. 
+ Zeal - A social photography challenge app built using React Native and Firebase, that three others and I worked on during the project phase of the Northcoders bootcamp.
+ NBA GM Simulator - Pair-programmed a fun desktop game that challenges the user to build a roster of basketball players without breaking the team's salary cap. Built as part of learning how to use React. 

## My developer journey 👨‍💻
+ Became interested in development through interviewing business leaders in Manchester's tech scene, and realised how important digital transformation is.
+ Began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my own time, and quickly grew to love it.
+ Handed in my notice and started the Northcoders intensive software development bootcamp in October 2020. 
+ Gained experience in JavaScript, Node JS, HTML, CSS, Jest, React, React Native, Express, Axios, API creation and integration, MVC modelling, PostgreSQL, and Firebase.

## Prior to becoming a developer 📰
+ Worked on the editorial team at Prolific North, covering all biggest tech, e-commerce, and marketing stories in the North of England.
+ Helped organise, promote, and deliver Manchester's first ever Digital City Festival in 2019.

## My qualifications 📚
+ 1st class degree in Journalism Studies from the University of Sheffield
+ Completed the Northcoders 13-week developer pathway bootcamp
+ A Levels: AAB (IT, Spanish, English)
